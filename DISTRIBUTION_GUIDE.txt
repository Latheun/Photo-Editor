HOW TO DISTRIBUTE PHOTO EDITOR TO USERS
====================================

This guide explains how to provide a standalone executable version of Photo Editor that works on ANY Windows computer without requiring Python or any other software.

STEP 1: BUILD THE EXECUTABLE (DEVELOPER ONLY)
-------------------------------------------
This step is done ONCE by the developer on a Windows machine with Python installed:

1. On your development computer, run:
   ```
   python package_to_exe.py
   ```

2. The script will create a completely standalone .exe file with everything bundled inside
   (PyInstaller packages Python, all libraries, and models into the executable)

3. The final package will be in the "dist/PhotoEditor" folder

STEP 2: PREPARE THE DISTRIBUTION PACKAGE
--------------------------------------
1. Zip the entire "dist/PhotoEditor" folder
   - This contains PhotoEditor.exe and the required folders
   - The zip file will be large (300-500 MB) because it contains everything

2. Name it something like "PhotoEditor_v1.0.zip"

STEP 3: DISTRIBUTE TO USERS
------------------------
Simply share the zip file with your users. They don't need Python or any other software.

WHAT USERS NEED TO DO
-------------------
Users simply:

1. Download and extract the zip file to any location on their computer
2. Double-click PhotoEditor.exe to run the application
3. Place their photos in the "input_photos" folder
4. Use the application to process photos
5. Find processed results in the "output_photos" folder

IMPORTANT: The executable contains EVERYTHING needed to run. It works on any Windows system (7/8/10/11) without installing Python or any libraries.

TROUBLESHOOTING FOR USERS
-----------------------
If users encounter issues:

1. Make sure they've extracted the entire zip file (not just running it from inside the zip)
2. Antivirus might initially block it - users may need to allow the application
3. First launch may be slower as Windows validates the new executable
